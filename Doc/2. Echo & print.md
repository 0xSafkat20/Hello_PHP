# 2.Echo and Print


In PHP, the `echo` and `print` statements are used to output text to the screen. These are fundamental commands that help display text, variables, and HTML code.

### Using `echo`

The `echo` statement is faster and can take multiple parameters (although this is rarely used). It does not return any value.
`echo` and `print` are almost same but echo is `faster` than print

```php
<?php
//echo
echo "Hello, World!";
//new line
echo "<br>";
//print
print "Hello, World!";
?>
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
```
