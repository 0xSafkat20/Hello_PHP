# Data Types

In PHP, variables can hold different types of data, and PHP is a loosely typed language, which means you don't need to declare a variable's data type explicitly. PHP will automatically determine the data type based on the value assigned.

### Common Data Types


## 1. String
   - A sequence of characters enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.
  
  ```php
  <?php
  $char = 'W';    //character variable
  $text = "Hello,";
  //br tag used for new line
  echo $text. "<br>" .$char;
  ?>
  ```


**Output:**
```
Hello,
W
```

## 2. Integer
   - A whole number, `positive` or `negative`, without a `decimal`.
  
  ```php
  <?php
  $number = 20;
  echo $number;
  ?>
  ```
  **Output:**
```
20
```

## 3. Float(Double)
   - A number with a `decimal point` or in exponential form.
  
  ```php
  <?php
  $height = 5.9;
  echo $height;
  ?>
  ```
  **Output:**
```
5.9
```

## 4. Boolean
   - Represents a value of `true` or `false`.
  
  ```php
  <?php
  $is_married = true;
  $is_admin = false
  //return 1 only if its true.
  echo $is_married;
  //*Dosn't return false*
  echo $is_admin;
  ?>
  ```

  **Output:**
```
1
```
