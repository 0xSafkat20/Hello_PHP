# 3.Variables

In PHP, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated throughout your code. `Variables` in PHP start with the `$` symbol followed by the variable name.

### Declaring Variables

Variables are created simply by assigning a value to a name with the `$` prefix.

```php
<?php
$name = "Safkat";    // String variable
$age = 19;           // Integer variable
$price = 999.99;     // Float variable
$is_active = true;   // Boolean variable
?>
```

```php
<?php
echo "Hello". $name. "You are now". $age. "years old ";
?>
```
