# PHP Basics

This guide covers basic PHP commands and syntax.

## 1. PHP Tags

PHP code is written between the `<?php` and `?>` tags.

```php
<?php
  // PHP code here
?>


# PHP Basics: Echo and Print

In PHP, the `echo` and `print` statements are used to output text to the screen. These are fundamental commands that help display text, variables, and HTML code.

## 1. Using `echo`

The `echo` statement is faster and can take multiple parameters (although this is rarely used). It does not return any value.

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
echo "Hello", " ", "World", "!";
?>
